# Workspace Scope

This is the FRONTEND repo (chillist-fe). Only modify files inside this repo.
NEVER modify files in chillist-be or any other sibling repo from this workspace.
If a task requires backend changes, stop and tell the user to switch to the backend repo.

The ONE exception: you MAY read and write files in ../chillist-docs/ (the shared docs repo) to read rules/docs and update dev-lessons, guides, specs, or rules when needed.

# How to Start Every Task

Before writing any code, FIRST use the Read tool on ALL of these files:

1. ../chillist-docs/rules/common.md (git workflow, planning, code standards, security)
2. ../chillist-docs/rules/frontend.md (clsx, TanStack Router, OpenAPI sync, testing)
3. ../chillist-docs/guides/frontend.md (setup, scripts, mock server, API layer, CI/CD)
4. ../chillist-docs/specs/mvp-v1.md (product requirements, entities, API endpoints)
5. ../chillist-docs/dev-lessons/frontend.md (past bugs - check before debugging)

Read the docs FIRST, then explore the specific files in this repo that are relevant to the task.
Do NOT scan the entire codebase upfront - only look at files directly related to the work.

# Updating Documentation

When you fix a bug, learn something new, or change workflow:
- Update ../chillist-docs/dev-lessons/frontend.md with the lesson
- If the fix implies a new rule, propose adding it to ../chillist-docs/rules/frontend.md
- If specs changed (features done, new endpoints), update ../chillist-docs/specs/mvp-v1.md
- If setup/scripts changed, update ../chillist-docs/guides/frontend.md
